# Introduction to UCM Starlight

![ucm arch](https://github.com/raycarroll/ucm/assets/3717348/2f0870d1-b90d-4a3d-b2d2-6fd8440d0959)

This diagram illustrates a data processing architecture utilising RabbitMQ to enable event-driven communication. This setup helps to parallelise and distribute the processing of large datasets across multiple nodes efficiently.

1. Event Producer Pod: This component reads spectrum data files from the mounted
Spectral Volume. It creates events (chunks of data) and publishes these events to RabbitMQ.

2. RabbitMQ: Acts as the message broker, managing the distribution of data events to various Processor Pods.

3. Processor Pods: Each of these pods subscribes to the RabbitMQ queue to receive data events. The Event Receiver container within each pod writes a data file in a format suitable for the Starlight application. The file is saved to a shared volume accessible to both containers within the pod.

4. Starlight Application: This application, triggered by a bash script, processes the new data file and saves the results back to a shared volume on the Event Producer Pod.

## Setup guide

### Prerequisites:

- kubernetes (https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
- kind (https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Kubernetes cluster and it's admin credentials for further actions 

## Locally

For local setup - additional requirement is Docker (https://www.docker.com/) and RabbitMQ instance (https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/download)

1. Set up RabbitMQ and make sure that the credentials in producer.go and receive.go are used correctly according to local environment.

2. Build images of the processor, receiver and starlight from the given Dockerfiles. 

```
docker build -t username/image_name .
```

3. Run the images to get the functional result:

```
docker run username/image_name
```

From the producer should be seen the following result:

```

user  user
pass  pass

2024/07/05 00:29:23 Num Files = 8

```

From the receiver:

```

## Deploy on a cluster (kind)

Useful UI tool - https://k8slens.dev/


The required files are located in: 
```
ucm/deployment/.
``` 
### Useful oc commands

1. To check the status of your pods

```
kubectl get pods -n _namespace_
``` 
2. To delete a deployment
```
kubectl delete deployment deployment_name -n your_namespace
```
3. To verify if RabbitMQ service is healthy and running
```
kubectl get svc -n your_namespace
```
4. To get the logs of a given pod
```
kubectl logs _podname_ -n _namespace_
```
5. To execute command in a pod:
```
kubectl exec -it _podname_ -- /bin/ bash
```

### Step to apply the deployment configurations:

First, we need to configure the volume, volumeclaim and rabbitmq:

```
kubectl apply -f ./volume.yaml -n _namespace_
```

```
kubectl apply -f ./volumeclaim.yaml -n _namespace_
```
```
kubectl apply -f ./deployment_rabbitmq.yaml -n _namespace_
```
### Then, we can start deployment of: deployment.yaml and deployment_starlight.yaml

```
kubectl apply -f _filename_ -n _namespace_
```

You should be able to see the following output (example):

```
deployment.apps/ucm-producer-deployment created 
```

## Once all pods are up, you can run the following command to copy the data in the input folder:

```
kubectl cp /some/path/to/inputfile . _podname_:/starlight/data/input/ -n _namespace_ 
```

## The Output data can be viewed in the /starlight/data/output directory. You can either exec into the pod to view or copy down to local directory:

```
kubectl exec --stdin --tty _podname_ -n _namespace_ -- /bin/bash
cd /starlight/data/output
```
OR
```
kubectl cp _podname_:/starlight/data/output/ /some/local/dir/ -n _namespace_ 
```
